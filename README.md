# Module_21  Neural Networks and Deep Learning
# Background
The premise of this assignment is that there is a nonprofit foundation, Alphabet Soup, that wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With the knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I used the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From Alphabet Soup’s data set, there is a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset there are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as:

- EIN and NAME—Identification columns
- APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
- AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
- CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
- USE_CASE—Use case for funding
- ORGANIZATION—Organization type
- STATUS—Active status
- INCOME_AMT—Income classification
- SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special considerations for application
- ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
- IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively
